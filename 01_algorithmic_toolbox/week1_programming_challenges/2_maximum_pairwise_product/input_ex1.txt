ind_1 = 0

ind_2 = 0


compare number[ind_1] with number[ind_2]

ind_2 is the index of the largest number
ind_1 is the index of the second largest number

if number[i] is larger than number[ind_2], it is the largest number. 
set ind_1 as ind_2
set ind_2 as i

scenario 1
n0    n1    numbers[i]

scenario 2
